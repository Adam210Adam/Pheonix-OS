# Pheonix-OS
## ⚠ This is a early prototype ⚠
  Some Features may be missing such as:
    Ethical Hacking
    Firewall
    Antivirus
    Web Browser
    Apps
    Desktop
  Please wait as me I am the only programmer working on this operating
  system.
> Note: when the operating System Starts And Fails that means
> that the required System packages aren't installed. Please
> install C, Python, C#, javascript, html, css with the packages
> for python it is very crucial to have a connection with pypi
> as it has all the packages and to have pip installed on the
> disk it is more likely for pip to be installed with python
> . The packages are "os", "tkinter" if os is not installed
> then a lot of things may fail like installing packages
> automatically ..etc.
